# VITALam API

## Description

A `Node.js` API to support communication to the [Substrate-based](https://www.substrate.io/) [`vitalam-node`](https://github.com/digicatapult/vitalam-node) (via [`polkadot-js/api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot/api)) and an [`IPFS`](https://ipfs.io/) node.

## Getting started

First, ensure you're running the correct [version](.node-version) of `npm`, then install dependencies using:

```
npm install
```

The API requires instances of [`vitalam-node`](https://github.com/digicatapult/vitalam-node) and [`IPFS`](https://ipfs.io/).
To bring them up locally:

### `vitalam-node`

Clone [vitalam-node](https://github.com/digicatapult/vitalam-node) and follow the README to setup and build a local node. Then run the following in its root directory:

```
./target/release/vitalam-node --dev
```

### `IPFS`

To install and run `IPFS` on macOS

```sh
brew install ipfs
ipfs daemon
```

Return to the root directory of this repository. Run the application in development mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Run tests:

```
npm run test:integration
```

## Authentication

`vitalam-api` uses an [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) Machine to Machine API to issue a JSON Web Token for authentication on its endpoints. You will need to create your own Auth0 API, which can be done for free, and set the appropriate [environment variables](#configuration) (those prefixed with `AUTH`). Follow the start of this [tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/nodejs#configure-auth0-apis) to create an API. Go [here](app/routes/auth.js) and [here](app/auth.js) to see where the environment variables are used.

## Configuration

The following environment variables are used by `vitalam-api` and can be configured. Entries marked as `required` are needed when running `vitalam-api` in production mode.

## Running the API

Having ensured dependencies are installed and running + the relevant environment variables are set, the API can be started in production mode with:

```
npm start
```

## API specification

### Access token endpoint

### POST /auth

Gets an `access_token` via Auth0 for using as authorisation on all other endpoints. Takes a `body` with the following format:

```js
{
    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // String
    "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" // String
}
```

This will return a JSON response (`Content-Type` `application/json`) of the form:

```js
{
    "access_token": "an.example.jwt", // String (JWT)
    "expires_in": 86400, // Number
    "token_type": "Bearer" // String
}
```

### Authenticated endpoints

The rest of the endpoints in `vitalam-api` require authentication in the form of a header `'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'`:

1. [GET /item/:id](#get-/item/:id)
2. [GET /item/:id/metadata/:metadataKey](#get-/item/:id/metadata/:metadataKey)
3. [POST /run-process](#POST-/run-process)
4. [GET /last-token](#get-/last-token)

The following endpoints are maintained for backwards compatibility:

1. [GET /item/:id/metadata](#get-/item/:id/metadata)

### GET /item/:id

Gets the item identified by `id`. Item `id`s are returned by [POST /run-process](#post-/run-process). This will return a JSON response (`Content-Type` `application/json`) of the form:

```js
{
    "id": 42, // Number
    "owner": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY", // String
    "creator": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY", // String
    "created_at": 4321, // Number
    "destroyed_at": 321 || null, // Nullable<Number>
    "parents": [40, 41], // Array<Number>
    "children": [43, 44] || null // Nullable<Array<Number>>
    "metadata": ["metadataKey1", ..."metadataKeyN"] // Array<String>
}
```

### GET /item/:id/metadata/:metadataKey

Gets the metadata file matching the `metadataKey` for the the item identified by `id`. Item `id`s are returned by [POST /run-process](#post-/run-process). The file will be returned with a `Content-Type` of `application/octet-stream`. The original `filename` is returned in the `Content-Disposition` header.

### POST /run-process

This endpoint governs the creation and destruction of all tokens in the system. The endpoint takes a `body` of a multi-part form constructed with a `request` field. The `request` field should be a JSON object with the following format:

```js
{
  "inputs": [40, 41] // Array<Number>,
  "outputs": [{ // Array<Output>
    "owner": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
    "metadata": {"metadataKey1": "some_file.txt", ..."metadataKeyN": "some_other_file.txt"}
  }]
}
```

The `inputs` field is an array of token `id`s that identifies the tokens to be consumed by running this process. To create tokens without destroying any inputs simply pass an empty array.

The `outputs` field is an array of objects that describe tokens to be created by running this process. To destroy tokens without creating any new ones simply pass an empty array. Each output must set the address of the `owner` of the new token. Each output must also reference a `metadata` object containing a (key, value) pair for each metadata file associated with a new token. The key identifies the metadata file, and the value is the filename. Each filename must match a corresponding file attached to the request.

The response of this API will be JSON (`Content-Type` `application/json`) of the following form

```json
[42, 43]
```

Each element of the array contains the `id` of the `output` that was described in the corresponding index of the `outputs` array.

### GET /last-token

Gets the `id` of the last item created by [POST /run-process](#post-/run-process). This will return a JSON response (`Content-Type` `application/json`) of the form:

```js
{
    "id": 5, // Number
}
```

### GET /item/:id/metadata

Maintained for backwards compatibility. New tokens should use [GET /item/:id/metadata/:metadataKey](#get-/item/:id/metadata/:metadataKey).

Gets the metadata file matching the `LEGACY_METADATA_KEY` env for the item identified by `id`. Item `id`s are returned by [POST /run-process](#post-/run-process). The file will be returned with a `Content-Type` of `application/octet-stream`. The original `filename` is returned in the `Content-Disposition` header.

### GET /members

Each element returned represents a member and their corresponding address in the following format:

```js
[
    {
        "address": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY"
    }
]
```
